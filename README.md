# Random-Walks
#Randomwalksim.py presents the simulation of a 2-D random walk.


#2d-histogram.py presents the simulation under reflecting boundary conditions and presents the histogram plot for P(n,t).

#The pde(processing file) is what is used to get a visual representation of the hexagonal lattice. The code for the random walk on the hexagonal lattice is in hex.jl. The MP4 file presents the simulation of the lattice random walk on the hexagonal lattice with reflecting boundaries.
