# Random-Walks
#Randomwalksim.py presents the simulation of a 2-D random walk.


#2d-histogram.py presents the simulation under reflecting boundary conditions and presents the histogram plot for P(n,t).

#The display_hex.pde(processing file) is what is used to get a visual representation of the hexagonal lattice. The code for the random walk on the hexagonal lattice is in hex_code.jl. The MP4 file presents the simulation of the lattice random walk on the hexagonal lattice with reflecting boundaries.

#hex_to_square_map.jl presents the simulation of the random walk on internal states with periodic boundary conditions.

#square_lattice (1).jl is the simulation of the random walk under reflecting boundary conditions and evaluates the analytic expression (Equation 4.1).

#hex_to_sqn_final.jl evaluates the analytic expression (Equation 3.10) that was derived in the paper.
